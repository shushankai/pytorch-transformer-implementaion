# pytorch-transformer-implementaion


This project is an implementation of the Transformer architecture introduced in the paper “Attention Is All You Need” by Vaswani et al.  ￼. The Transformer model utilizes self-attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional neural networks, and has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various sequence transduction tasks, particularly in machine translation.
